# Arc-Detection-system
Using opencv, an Electrical Arc Detection system was created to detect any visible arcs. It detects any event that is characterized by a bright flash of light. 
Algorithm uses the popular OpenCV function to detect any events within the frame, 
check for the intensity of the events,
and isolate the event-frame, which is further clipped/stitched together with other frame
